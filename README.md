MicroGPT-Caller is a **lightweight GPT-2 based model fine-tuned for function calling**. It takes a Python list of tool names and a user query string as input, automatically determines the correct function to call, executes it, and returns the result.  

This project shows how a small, custom-trained model can handle structured tasks efficiently, offering a fast and low-cost alternative to large API-based solutions.

## Features
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 on **10k synthetic samples** for function calling.  
- Automatically parses user queries and calls the appropriate function from a provided Python tools list.  
- Returns results directly without relying on external APIs.  
- Demo notebook (`demo.ipynb`) includes example executions and explains the **necessity and advantages** of this approach over large API-based models.
