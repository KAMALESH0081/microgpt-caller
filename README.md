MicroGPT-Caller is a **lightweight GPT-2 based model fine-tuned for function calling**. It takes a Python list of tool names and a user query string as input, automatically determines the correct function to call, executes it, and returns the result.  

This project shows how a small, custom-trained model can handle structured tasks efficiently, offering a fast and low-cost alternative to large API-based solutions.

## Quick Usage Example

```python
from auto_agent import AutoAgent

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers"""
    return a + b

def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Subtracts second number from first"""
    return a - b

# Initialize agent with your tools
agent = AutoAgent(tools=[add, sub])

# Run a query
print(agent.run("add 5 and 3"))  # ‚Üí 8

# for more see demo.ipynb
```

## Features
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 on **10k synthetic samples** for function calling.  
- Automatically parses user queries and calls the appropriate function from a provided Python tools list.  
- Returns results directly without relying on external APIs.  
- Demo notebook (`demo.ipynb`) includes example executions.

## Why MicroGPT-Caller?

MicroGPT-Caller is an **offline, lightweight GPT-2 fine-tuned for function calling**, designed to replace large API LLMs in structured tasks.  

**Advantages:**  
-  Efficient & fast (runs locally on ~6GB VRAM)  
-  Private (no data sent to servers)  
-  Cost-free after training  
-  Fine-tuned for your specific tools  

**Use Cases:**  
- On-device assistants & automation  
- IoT / edge devices needing offline execution  
- Budget-limited projects where API calls are expensive
